# Enable reading streams with the HLS protocol.
hls: yes
# Address of the HLS listener.
hlsAddress: :8888
# Enable TLS/HTTPS on the HLS server.
# This is required for Low-Latency HLS.
hlsEncryption: no
# Path to the server key. This is needed only when encryption is yes.
# This can be generated with:
# openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
# openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650
hlsServerKey: server.key
# Path to the server certificate.
hlsServerCert: server.crt
# Value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header provided in every HTTP response.
# This allows to play the HLS stream from an external website.
hlsAllowOrigin: '*'
# List of IPs or CIDRs of proxies placed before the HLS server.
# If the server receives a request from one of these entries, IP in logs
# will be taken from the X-Forwarded-For header.
hlsTrustedProxies: []
# By default, HLS is generated only when requested by a user.
# This option allows to generate it always, avoiding the delay between request and generation.
hlsAlwaysRemux: no
# Variant of the HLS protocol to use. Available options are:
# * mpegts - uses MPEG-TS segments, for maximum compatibility.
# * fmp4 - uses fragmented MP4 segments, more efficient.
# * lowLatency - uses Low-Latency HLS.
hlsVariant: lowLatency
# Number of HLS segments to keep on the server.
# Segments allow to seek through the stream.
# Their number doesn't influence latency.
hlsSegmentCount: 7
# Minimum duration of each segment.
# A player usually puts 3 segments in a buffer before reproducing the stream.
# The final segment duration is also influenced by the interval between IDR frames,
# since the server changes the duration in order to include at least one IDR frame
# in each segment.
hlsSegmentDuration: 1s
# Minimum duration of each part.
# A player usually puts 3 parts in a buffer before reproducing the stream.
# Parts are used in Low-Latency HLS in place of segments.
# Part duration is influenced by the distance between video/audio samples
# and is adjusted in order to produce segments with a similar duration.
hlsPartDuration: 200ms
# Maximum size of each segment.
# This prevents RAM exhaustion.
hlsSegmentMaxSize: 50M
# Directory in which to save segments, instead of keeping them in the RAM.
# This decreases performance, since reading from disk is less performant than
# reading from RAM, but allows to save RAM.
